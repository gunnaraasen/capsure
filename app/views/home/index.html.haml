      <strong>New York City Community Board meetings</strong>, or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_boards_in_New_York_City'>CB meetings</a> are the advisory boards that deal with a range of local matters; from land use and rezoning, to identifying community needs as part of the city's budget process and working with city agencies to resolve local service issues. Community Boards chat about local problems, and work together to fix them.

      CCBNYC lets you find out <strong>when</strong> and <strong>where</strong> your next meeting is, in an effort to get more New Yorkers involved in community policing.
